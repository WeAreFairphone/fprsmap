# Fairphone Community Map
>_`fprsmap` - abbreviation for "Fairphoners Map"_

## About
The idea for the Fairphone Community Map originated in March 2015 in [a topic][1] on the [Fairphone Forum][2]. The goal is to map the global Fairphone Community and make it easier to find relevant people and places in the user's area.

The map can currently be found at https://map.fairphone.community/ or at https://wearefairphone.github.io/fprsmap/.

## Embed the map
Simply click the embed button ![embed icon][icon] inside the map and you will find the embed code ready to be copied. The embed code provided there will update itself according to the layers you select.

The embed code uses an [iframe][3]. You can also have a look at it here:

```html
<iframe src="https://map.fairphone.community/" width="100%" height="400" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0">
  <p><a href="https://map.fairphone.community/" target="_blank">See the Fairphone Community Map!</a></p>
</iframe>
```
Modify the `width` and `height` parameters to your liking.

## Status of the Project & Contributions
At the moment we are trying to gather as many relevant sources for the map as possible. Please look at the [issues list][4] and help us out\* or give feedback. We are looking forward to your contribution! At the moment there are four categories:

- `angels` ([Local support volunteers][11], so called _Fairphone Angels_)
- `repairshops` ([Repair shops][14] that are familiar with Fairphones)
- `events` (Meetups & Events of the Fairphone Community, as of the [official Fairphone Events page][15] and forum sources.)

\* A [how-to for building the map locally][16] can be found in the Wiki.

## Usage examples
The categories mentioned in the previous paragraph can be used to define an initial state of the map.

- Say you want to promote Fairphone Community events. Append `?show=events` to the URI and only meetups and events will be loaded into the map at start.
- Multiple parameters are also possible: `https://map.fairphone.community/?show=events,angels` will display both the `events` and the `angels` layers.
- By default only those two layers are loaded.

## Acknowledgements
Thank you to [Fairphone][5] for their great support of community projects. They listen to our needs and take into account our requirements for the map.

Last but not least, we want to mention [Leaflet.js][7]. It's really a pleasure to work with their great JavaScript library to build this map!
